          <li>Used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>

          <li>Meta-related, Content division, and Semantic elements are commonly used to divide and describe a page.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visbile content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users and is not typically seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <u1>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users or add style to the webpage.</li> 
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet is the most common way to style a webpage and is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of that property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box and each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content (CSS box model).</li>
          <li>Class Attributes allow developers to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a calss attribute with a class sector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
