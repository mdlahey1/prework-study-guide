To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by processing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
